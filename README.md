# Mario’s MCP

This repository contains a minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. MCP is a way for an AI client (like an agent or desktop app) to connect to external capabilities (tools) through a standard protocol.
At a high level: MCP = JSON-RPC messages over a transport (usually stdio or HTTP).
